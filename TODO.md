# TODO

## mediasoup-client-aiortc

* Fill `README.md`.

* Why is there a `Handler` class in `worker.py` and why does requests and notifications call `handler.xxx()` instead of directly doing the stuff? Do we really need such a `Handler` class and `handler` singleton?

* DataChannel.
  - No "error" event implemented in aiortc.
  - "message" events generated by aiortc are not wrapped into a `MessageEvent` but, instead, the "message" event is emitted with a `data` argument that may be a string or a binary. Take it into consideration.
  - We do not update `dc.bufferedAmount` in JS. We may notify its native value from py to JS for each sent message, received message, 'bufferedamountlow' event, etc. 
  - Let's figure out how to deal with binary messages for sending and receiving, we should encode them somehow to JSON serializable text, i.e. base64:

```python
>>> empty_bytes = bytes(4)
>>> type(empty_bytes).__name__
'bytes'

>>> foo = "hehe"
>>> type(foo).__name__
'str'
```

  - Let's figure out how to deal with `binaryType` stuff (aiortc does not implement it since it just makes sense in JS).
  - Need tests.
  - Eventually I got this (before fixing the "open" event stuff so it may never happen again):

## aiortc

Things that must be verified, asked or even reported in aiortc project.

* `Aiortc.js` uses always `this._setupTransport({ localDtlsRole: 'server'` because aiortc fails to honor given DTLS role in the remote SDP offer and assumes it must always be 'server'.
  - Reported and explained: https://github.com/aiortc/aioice/issues/15

* Must report lack of `track.enabled = xxx` to pause sending RTP (or generate silence or black video with less bitrate).
  - Reported: https://github.com/aiortc/aiortc/issues/264
  - Store the legit track and replace the track `replaceTrack` with the base audio or video track.
